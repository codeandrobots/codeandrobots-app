# App Properties
#
# When running the app locally, it will rely on the properties defined in the .env file.
#
# On first setup, be sure to copy .env.example to .env.
# The Beta app will rely on the .env.beta file.
# The app in production (not yet launched) will rely on the .env.production file.
#

# ENV can either be dev, test, beta or production
ENV=dev
